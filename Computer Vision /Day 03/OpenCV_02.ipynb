    "- The first value `(0)` represents the blue component, which is set to 0, meaning there is no blue in the color.\n",
    "- The second value `(255)` represents the green component, which is set to its maximum value of 255, meaning the color is fully green.\n",
    "- The third value `(0)` represents the red component, which is set to 0, meaning there is no red in the color.\n",
